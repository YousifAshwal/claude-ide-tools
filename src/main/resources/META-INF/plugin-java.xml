    Java-specific extension points are intentionally NOT registered here.

    Design Decision: Java handlers (JavaMoveHandler, JavaExtractMethodHandler) use
    direct imports for Java-specific classes rather than reflection. This provides:
    1. Compile-time type safety and IDE support
    2. Better performance (no reflection overhead)
    3. Cleaner code that's easier to maintain

    The handlers are registered as legacy adapters in LanguageHandlerRegistry.kt
    and are protected by the optional dependency declaration in plugin.xml:
    <depends optional="true" config-file="plugin-java.xml">com.intellij.java</depends>

    This means the ClassLoader will only load JavaMoveHandler/JavaExtractMethodHandler
    when the Java plugin is available, preventing ClassNotFoundException in WebStorm/PhpStorm.

    Extension points are used for other languages (Kotlin, Python, etc.) that require
    reflection-based access to avoid compile-time dependencies on optional plugins.
